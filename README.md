Designed to compete it Smart City Challenge Hack.
A sustainability hack for UOttaHack 2018. 

SeeingIsBusLeaving is a hardware based solution used to encourage people to take public transportation more often through the means of accessability and data visualization. 

The hack aims to specifically help low income residents of towns who don't have a access to a mobile device with data to check bus schedules and arrival times. SeeingIsBusLeaving does this by allowing a transit system to communicate with specific hardware nodes via SMS. This solution is cost efficient, reliable, and low maintenance. No human interaction is involved. 

At full potential, our solution would allow the user to easily learn of the busses location by laying out LEDs on the board over a map. Each LED represents a bus stop on a route. Two sequential LEDs lighting up indicates that there is currently a bus between the two stops. If there are more than one busses at a single stop, the sign should accomodate for the routes. In this prototype we use a blue tooth module since we do not have access to a GSM module to allow for SMS. The LEDs would also line up with bus routes and stops.
